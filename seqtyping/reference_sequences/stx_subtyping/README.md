# stx subtyping

Escherichia coli stx subtypes DB

---

## Info

stx subtypes sequences database was produced on 27/Nov/2018 from [Virulencefinder Database](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/virulencefinder_db) (commit _2159310_) using `get_stx_db.py` script found in `seq_typing/modules/` folder.  
  
_stx2a_, _stx2c_ and _stx2d_ sequences are combined in one subtype called stx2acd. This is due to the fact that all of those subtypes are the most potent ones to cause HUS and cannot be separated from each other by the methods in use right now.  
Sequences without subtype were excluded. For sequences having IUPAC codes, a random sequence was produced based on the IUPAC codes.
