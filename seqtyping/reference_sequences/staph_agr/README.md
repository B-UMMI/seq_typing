# agr Locus Typing for Staphylococcus aureus

Determination of agr Type for Staphylococcus aureus based on the agr Locus determination
---

## Info
Database created from the complete agr locus locus from reference strains (see list below- TBD).
The order or reporting is the determination using Full Locus, agrB,agrC and agrD. agrA is not used due to lack of discriminatiory ability between agr Types.
Congruence between results obtained on the Full locus and any of the genes is sufficient to determine agr Type.
